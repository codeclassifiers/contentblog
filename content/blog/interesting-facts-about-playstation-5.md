* With the unveiling of Playstation 5 by Sony, most of us are eagerly waiting to see first hand reviews and gameplay footage of latest games on the next gen console. 
  Here are 5 interesting facts about PS5:  
* **It's huge!**
  * PlayStation 5 is significantly larger than the PlayStation 4. It’s also taller than the Xbox Series X.  
  * Matt MacLaurin, the vice president of UX Design at PlayStation, explained the reasoning behind its size on his LinkedIn page:
    “This gen is little supercomputers. While the 7nm process delivers amazing heat performance for the power, the power is very extreme. This tech is still so fresh it throws a lot of heat so we need room to dissipate,”
  * Reddit user u/GREBO7 posted an [image](https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxSeriesX/comments/h7cmty/updated_console_sizes_compared/) which compared the sizes of many of the recent PlayStation and Xbox consoles. These include the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox Series X, Xbox One X and others. He used the standard sizes of the disc drives and USB ports to estimate the size of the PlayStation 5 system and it seems significantly larger than other consoles in this [image](https://preview.redd.it/m68gq2vi8e451.png?width=2868&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e00cbac6967e6cc65d7af41da370e66b2f31fbb)
* **A completely redesigned UI**
  * Matt MacLaurin has further stated that "User interface will be a completely new, a 100 percent overhaul of the PS4 UI and some very different new concepts. The UI will be pragmatic and will be based on a new visual language.
    The major focus is speed: “Most important is experience goals measured in milliseconds across the entire UI"
* **Specs and Power**
  * Playstation 5 contains an octa-core AMD Zen 2 CPU with a custom Radeon GPU, which stacks it up very closely to the Xbox Series X which means the PS5 will be capable of ray tracing. 
  * It also features an SSD instead of a hard drive for storage, which should further boost performance, just like the Series X. The SSD seems to be the most significant aspect of the PS5, as Sony has heavily promoted the near-instant load times. We just need to wait and see if it holds true.
* **8K visuals**
  * The PlayStation 5 will apparently be capable of producing 8K visuals.
  * We don't expect that any games will take advantage of this feature anytime soon. This capability seems more like a measure of future-proofing so that once 8k TVs become affordable and developers start shipping 8k resolution support, people can actually try this feature.
* **Launch games**
  * Some of the most anticipated games coming to the PS5 include Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Godfall, Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, Resident Evil 8: Village, Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart and Gran Turismo 7 among others.
* **Conclusion**
  * With such great deal of features, updated specs and games releasing for playstation 5, the gaming community is surely going to get a lot of improved and exciting experience while playing games on the console.
